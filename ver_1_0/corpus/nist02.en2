Severe Sandstorm Hits Beijing Again
( AFP report from Beijing ) - China's state media said a severe sandstorm hit Beijing again yesterday .
Although the government has invested huge funds improving Beijing's environment and trying to keep desert off Beijing , it is still a major problem faced by the city where the 2008 Olympics is to be held .

Yang Weixi , chief engineer of the Desert Control Centre of the Ministry of Forestry of China told Beijing Weekly : " I dare not say there will not be sandstorms in 2008 .
What we can do is to control the human factors that contribute to sandstorms and prevent desertification of the environment . "

The Chinese government has vowed to invest 56.8 billion yuan ( approximately 12.376 billion Singapore dollars ) from 2002 to 2008 to prevent desertification and reduce sandstorms .

The survey found in the first 6 months of last year , there occurred 18 sandstorms in Beijing and all the sand was originating from Inner Mongolia , where 60 percent of the land is desert .
At the National People's Congress that has just closed this month , delegates from Shanghai , Beijing and Inner Mongolia urged the government to " build a green Great Wall ( of trees ) " to hold off sandstorms .

The government also said that the increase of cases were mainly due to sharp increase in cases that involve robbery of mobile phones , with over 700,000 such cases reported across the country last year .
This is the first time British police focuses its crackdown on street hooligans and holdups , while previous crackdown was focused on illegal possession of guns and street hawking of drugs .
The new program will be carried out first in 10 crime-prone street blocks .
Police will increase patrol of these blocks and provide more protection to the victims .

Singapore Airlines Air Crash Investigation Report : FSCT Delays Over And Again , Prosecutors Suspect Untold Reasons
( Report from Taipei ) - The investigation report of the Flight Safety Committee of Taiwan ( FSCT ) has been delayed over and again one and a half years after the Singapore Airlines crash , bringing the investigation of the local prosecution of TaoYuan County to a standstill . The local prosecution suspects untold reasons as FSCT promised to submit the report in April .
At 11 : 18 on October 31 , 2000 , an aircraft of Singapore Airlines on an SQ-006 flight from Chiang Kai-shek Airport to Los Angels of US mistakenly ran into the 05 runway when taking off , rammed into two dredges and exploded , leaving 83 passengers dead and up to 100 wounded .
China Times reported yesterday that the Local Prosecution of TaoYuan County responsible for investigation of the criminal liabilities have fought a few rounds for the investigating power .
Since the air crash took place , Chief Prosecutor of the Local Prosecution of TaoYuan County , Wang Tien-Shen has been promoted to the position of Chief Prosecutor of TaiChung City and he was succeeded by Chen Shiu-Huang , while the acting prosecutor Huang Mo-Shen was also transferred to the Prosecution of Taipei and the case was passed on to Jiang Yun-Jen .
FSCT once claimed the investigation report would be finalized by the end of last year , but delayed it until the end of January before putting it off again to February . With the actual date still unknown , the FSCT , urged by the Prosecution , has promised to submit the report in April .
As the destination of the SQ-006 flight is Los Angels , relatives of some victims have brought actions at US courts for huge civil claims against the Singapore Airlines as well as the Aviation Bureau of Taiwan .
The claims of the victims' relatives are based on accusation of negligence by the Aviation Tower and administrators in Taiwan . Therefore , the conclusion of the Local Prosecution of TaoYuan Country will be of exceptional concern .

Over Half Britons Oppose Government's Backing of US Attack on Iraq
( Summary of reports from London ) - The result of a public poll released yesterday suggests over half British voters are against the government's backing of US attack on Iraq .
The result of the poll conducted by the Guardian newspaper and a polling agency , ICM , suggest that 51 percent of the voters are against British government's support of US attack on Iraq .
This is contrary to the result of similar polls conducted three years ago , when most of British voters backed attack on Iraq .
Similar poll results released the day before yesterday by US Cable New Network and Time magazine show 70 percent of Americans back their government to overthrow the Hussein regime .
Canadian Prime Minister Chretien said in Ottawa the day before yesterday that Canada would consider joining if US leads allied forces to attack Iraq .

But Chretien appears to have changed his stance after meeting with Bush in Washington last Thursday .
He told Columbia Broadcasting System that he would seriously consider any requests by US for military aid in areas other than Afganistan .

US Senator : Terrorists Infected with Small Pox May Disseminate Viruses at Airport
( AP report from Washington D . C . ) - US Senator Dr . Frist warned the day before yesterday at a hearing on biochemical weapons that terrorists infected with small pox may disseminate deadly viruses or bacteria at the airport and spread the viruses throughout the country to kill millions of people .
Frist said at the hearing that terrorists infected with small pox , once entering an airport , may spread the viruses by coughing , sniffing or mere breathing to 10 innocent passengers , who may continue to spread the virus throughout the country to infect millions of people and kill them .
He said this may be the possible form of weapons of mass destruction .
It does not need a missile to launch , nor would it be as conspicuous as the anthrax .
The sufferers of the virus and the guards against the weapon may never know where the virus ( bacteria ) come from .
Experts told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that this is part of the reason that bio-chemical weapons are so dangerous .
Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said prevention of the attack of biochemical weaponry is " an urgent issue that must be addressed . "
Helms , the most senior Republican Senator of the committee , said US still needs to establish the Missile Defense System to prevent missiles carrying any kind of bombs from the enemy to attack US .
Hundreds of Thousands of Soldiers from US and ROK Launch Large-Scale Exercise
( AFP report from Seoul ) - Hundreds of thousands of soldiers from US and the Republic of Korea will be launching the largest-ever military exercise on Thursday to simulate conflict with DPR Korea , who has denounced it as provocative .
US army officials said before the week-long military exercise that this exercise was purely defensive , but it happens after Seoul warned of the danger of ignoring the DPRK issue .
This is the largest military exercise since the 1950 - 53 Korean War . Since no formal treaty was concluded to end the conflict on the Korean Peninsula , it has become the world's last frontier of Cold War , putting up to 2 million troops in a state of confrontation .
The joint US-ROK Combined Forces Command ( CFC ) based in Seoul said the exercise from March 21 to 27 is the first time to combine two different joint exercises to see its effect .
It means involvement of hundreds of thousands of soldiers , but the military has not disclosed any details .
A spokesman for CFC said almost all US and ROK military units based in the Korean Peninsula are deployed in addition to the incoming US troops .
Some 37,000 US soldiers are stationed in ROK permanently to prevent the 1.1 million DPRK troops from launching any attacks .
ROK has an army of 650,000 .
The CFC named this exercise RS01 / FE02 , which is a combination of computerized military exercise and the annual exercise , " Little Eagle " .
In the past few years , 500,000 ROK soldiers and 30,000 American soldiers ( including 20,000 incoming American soldiers ) were deployed in the RS01 exercise .
DPRK accused US of intending to wage a war by holding the joint exercise .
The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper even described the joint exercise of ROK and US as a " declaration of war " .
Chinese Media Praise Strategic Missile Corps
( AFP report from Beijing ) - China's official media yesterday praised its strategic missile corps amidst controversy over the US Nuclear Situation Assessment naming China as a target of nuclear attack .
The PLA Daily , the People's Daily and other official daily newspapers published on their front pages stories headlined " Building Shield of Peace for the Republic " , trumpeting the No . 2 Artillery including the strategic missile corps and the nuclear weapon corps .
The story describes that the Artillery used " strategic missile simulation system " , to simulate nuclear attacks from an enemy country and the counterattack of " Red Army " or China .
The " Red Army " quickly drew up war plan with modern programs , deploying missile launchers in the depth of mountains and forests .
The story strewed with technical terms described the No . 2 Artillery as having displayed its awful might using new anti-intervention and anti-espionage technologies .
The story continued that one missile after another " was shot up into sky from the depth of mountains and precisely hit the target , wrapping up a successful counterattack . "
The No . 2 Artillery , estimated to be armed with about 100,000 officers and soldiers , constitutes the core of Chinese army committed to upgrading its military technology .
The story that recounts the history of China's missile and nuclear corps was published when Sino-US relations were getting tense again .
China Steps Up Guarding in Embassy Quarters to Prevent Koreans " Break-in " Again
( Report from Hong Kong ) - The Chinese police carried out internal review the other day of the incident last week that 25 DPR Koreans broke into the Spanish embassy .
It is estimated that more than 150 DPR Koreans in Beijing alone are attempting to go to the Republic of Korea . The authorities have stepped up guarding of the embassies of ROK , Japan and major Western countries so as to prevent " break-in " from happening again .
Sing Tao Daily reported yesterday that sources to the public security agencies said Beijing police has extended guarding from some sensitive countries after the September 11 attack to those less sensitive countries and stepped up liaison with Beijing-based staff of the embassies of DPRK and ROK .
Sources said ROK embassy personnel told Chinese officials that ROK has not backed any DPR Koreans to get to ROK in such a manner and ROK would not like such things happen again to affect relationship between China and the two sides of the Korean Peninsula . ROK also promised to assist China in the administration of Koreans in Beijing .
It was revealed that the Dongcheng District and the Liangmahe area of Chaoyang District of Beijing are inhabited by about 10,000 Koreans , most of whom are ethnic Koreans from Northeast China and some from DPRK and ROK , who mainly operate Korean-style restaurants and bars . As Koreans , they live in peace together regardless of where they come from .
There were not many Korean nationals in Beijing before and few were involved in criminal cases like people from Xinjiang and Henan , making them the less conspicuous target of surveillance of the authorities .
Reports said the Ministry of Public Security " invited " the German doctor who assisted the 25 Koreans to the public security agencies to " have a talk " after the March 14 incident and sent him to the airport shortly afterwards and demanded him to leave China immediately .
The public security and the state security agencies began internal review afterwards .
The review was centered around two aspects : the guarding of the embassy quarters and administration of ethnic Koreans in Beijing .
The authorities also requested related agencies in areas like Jilin to take effective measures to keep Koreans illegally entering Chinese territory from going to Beijing .

Asteroid Capable of Ruining a Mid-sized City Passed by Earth
( AP report from Melbourne , Florida ) - An asteroid big enough to ruin a mid-sized city passed by in a close range of 463,000 kilometres off Earth without being noticed in advance . Astronomers learned of the event four days later .
The asteroid , about 50 metres in diameter , came in the direction of Sun , which made it hard for astronomers to discover .
The asteroid passed by the Earth on March 8 , but was discovered on March 12 when it was gone .
Williams from the International Association of Astronomy based in Cambridge of Massachusetts helped position the asteroid .
The asteroid was very close to the Earth in astronomic terms , because the Moon is 402,000 kilometres off Earth .
Williams told the Florida-based newspaper , Today , on Wednesday , " The key is that the asteroid should have been discovered before it started off in the direction of Sun .
Only that would make the astronomers ascertain the asteroid's orbit as early as possible and forecast whether it will hit Earth .
In 1908 , an asteroid of the similar size hit the Earth , leaving a pit 32 kilometres wide in Siberia's forests .
Minister of Internal Affairs Confirms the Senior Adviser to the Italian Government Shot Dead by Red Brigade
( AFP report from Rome ) - Scajola , Italian Minister of Internal Affairs confirmed the day before yesterday that Biagi , a senior advisor to the Italian government was shot dead by a branch of Italy's left-wing guerrilla Red Brigade .

Biagi once helped drafting an employment reform scheme that was been strongly opposed by the trade unions and the left-wing .
They thought the scheme would make it easier for employers to fire workers .
Witnesses said Biagi was lying in blood with his file case on his side
The door of Biagi's house was found to have been inscribed with a star symbolizing the Red Brigade , but it is not known when the inscription was made .
The Red Brigade was founded in 1973 and has been involved in many bombings and assassinations in Italy in the 1970s and 80s , including the kidnapping and killing of former Prime Minister Moro in 1978 .

( AP report from Beijing ) - The No . 1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing yesterday sentenced Chinese American engineer Fang Fuming 5 years in jail on charges of illegal procurement of the State secrets and bribing on behalf of a company .
This case has drawn protest from the US .
A spokesman for the US embassy to China said Fang Fuming will be expelled after he finishes serving his sentence .
The term of imprisonment will be adjusted to the time he has served in jail .
The US embassy sent a diplomat to observe the court hearing .
The lawyer representing Fang Fuming said his client has been jailed for two years , but China has denied the said period of jail .
Xihua News Agency has confirmed the relevant judgement .
It said Fang Fuming acquired 35 documents containing State secrets from 1995 to 1999 and bribed Chinese civil servants with US $ 245,000 ( Approximate 450,000 Singapore dollars ) to help foreign investors bid for China's electricity projects .
Fang Fuming is a consultant on electricity projects for a foreign company in China and other Asian areas .
Fang Fuming's lawyer Kohn said that Fang Fuming denied bribery and said he was a victim of corrupted Chinese officials in the electricity administration .
Fang Fuming was an official in China's electricity administration and became a US citizen in 1994 .
A handful of US citizens and residents have been accused of violating China's State Security Law in the past two years and Fang is one of them .
Fang Fuming's detention caused the tension of the Sino-American relations for a while
The US government has repeatedly protested against China's approach in handling Fang Fuming's case , accusing Chinese authorities of violating international principles by detaining Fang Fuming for months without holding a hearing .
Fang Fuming's family said he was badly treated .

China Cancels Naval fleet visit to US and Refuses to Confirm Hu Jingtao's Scheduled Visit
( Summary of reports from Beijing ) - The warming relations between US and China brought about by US President Bush's visit to China has turned cold rapidly as China confirmed yesterday to have cancelled its naval fleet's visit to the US ports this year , and refused to confirm whether Vice-President Hu Jingtao will visit the US as scheduled .
Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said when answering questions at the regular press conference , " As far as I know , China's naval fleet is being prepared for a planned visit , which does not include US ports . "
When asked twice by a journalist whether Hu Jingtao's visit to the US has been affected and when requested to clarify whether the earlier reply could be understood as that Hu Jingtao's visit to the US in April will go on as scheduled , Zhang made no comments or confirmation .
Zhang Qiyue just repeated accusations that the US " has done a series of things in violation of the three joint Communiques between China and the US " within only one month following Bush's visit to China , and requested that the US " stop interfering in China's internal affairs with the Taiwan issue . "
In another development , in Washington on Wednesday the US paid no attention to China's warning that " cold wind " is blowing on Sino-US relations and insisted that it is not improper to permit Taiwan's Defence Minister to attend the " US-Taiwan Defence Summit " held in Florida .
Beijing has repeatedly hit out at the US issuing visa to Taiwanese Defence Minister Tang Yiau-ming earlier this month to attend the meeting hosted by the US arms dealers .
Tang Yiau-ming also met with two senior officials of the US government at that time .
Richard Boucher , Spokesman for the US State Department was questioned by journalists at the regular press conference on China's protest of the issue , but he apparently tried to avoid squabble with China .
He said , " Our stance is known to everyone after the meeting . "
" If you would ask me about the issue everyday , I would like to explain it everyday . If China would ask about the issue everyday , we would explain it everyday . "
He said , " Our stance has not changed . These are normal contacts between us and the Taiwanese and we will continue to do so . "
Zhang Qiyue yesterday also confirmed the Russian press reports that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had a phone call with Russian President Putin at the request of the latter , and the two sides exchanged views on cooperation between China and Russia based on mutual benefit . "
Both sides believed that the cooperation between China and Russia on mutual benefit is in the interest of both the countries and their people .
