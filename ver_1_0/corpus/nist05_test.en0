The star-crossed marriage between Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and US marine Johnson was once extensively feted on US television . However , it has come to an end in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after only five years .
Meriam is a member of the Gulf country Bahrain's royal family . Johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair , Their fairy-tale marriage became the subject of a television movie .
But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that after only five years , the couple is headed to the court after Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions .
The pair met in 1999 when career military man Johnson was stationed in Bahrain .
But his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love .
Their union was forbidden by the royal family , so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to America .
After a bitter immigration battle with US authorities , the couple finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the famed and glitzy Las Vegas Strip when Johnson was 23 and the bride only 19 .
However , Johnson says that their star-crossed union comes to an end because of the temptations of the " Sin City " of Las Vegas , the constant tensions with Meriam's rich and powerful family and rumors of an assassination plot against him .
Johnson says his work was to park the cars of hotel and casino guests while Meriam was increasingly tempted by the nightlife of the gambling city , frequenting clubs late at night and ignoring her husband .
