Bahraini Princess Marries a U . S . soldier ; Astounding Marriage Dissolves in 5 Years
U . S . television stations had once feted the marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam al-Khalifa and U . S . marine Johnson . However , after just five years , this star-crossed marriage has already come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas .
Meriam is a member of the royal family of the Gulf country of Bahrain . Johnson risked his military career over this forbidden love affair . Their fairy-tale marriage was once the theme of a television movie .
Nonetheless , according to the Las Vegas Review Journal , only five years later , the couple went to court when Meriam filed for divorce in Las Vegas , where getting married is quick but getting divorced is quicker .
The two met in 1999 , when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain .
After he met this teenage princess , the pair fell in love and his life thus changed tremendously .
Since the royal family forbade the union of these two young lovers , Johnson smuggled Meriam out of her country and into the United States by disguising her in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , and forging her military identification papers .
After fighting a difficult immigration battle with the U . S . authorities , the couple was finally married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip , famous for its opulence . At that time , Johnson was 23 , and the bride was only 19 .
However , Johnson stated that because of the many temptations in Las Vegas , so-called " Sin City , " the continuous tensions between him and Meriam's rich and powerful family , and the rumor of plots to assassinate him , this marriage , which had endured all kinds of hardships , finally dissolved .
Johnson said that he worked as a parking valet for hotel and casino guests , while Meriam gradually got sucked into the nightlife of the casino city . She frequented nightclubs late at night and ignored her husband .
