Xinhua News Agency , Johannesburg , March 18 ( Reporter Gao Yuan ) Motlanthe , secretary general of African National Congress ( ANC ) , the ruling party of South Africa , criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations .

He pointed out , mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by ; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation .
If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe , Motlanthe said , they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe .
He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis .
He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe .
Earlier , ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time .

They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe .
At present , some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe .
Before the election , EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced " targeted " sanctions against Zimbabwe .

Marc-Antoine Audette and Sebastien Trudel , employees of a Canadian Quebec radio station CKMF-FM , got through to Bill Gates on the phone on April 1 and claimed to be the Canadian Prime Minister Chretien . He imitated the prime minister's voice several times and had an intimate conversation with him for as long as 10 minutes .
The topics of the conversation covered the world economy and the shortcomings of " Windows " operation system , and Bill Gates was also invited to visit Quebec at an appropriate time .
The radio station aired the recording of the conversation in its entertainment program on the evening of the 2nd , and on the next day re-aired it at the request of its listeners .

Xinhua News Agency , Ankara , April 5 ( Reporter Huai Chengbo ) Karzai , prime minister of the Afghan interim government , demanded again on the 5th in Ankara that the multi-national peace keeping troops in Afghanistan extend their mission to areas outside the capital of Kabul .

Earlier this year , Karzai requested that the UN extend the mission area of the peace-keeping troops and station them in areas outside the capital of Kabul .
Such an action , he said , would send out a signal that the international community assumes its obligations toward a country ravaged by war for 23 years .

However , concerned about the safety in areas outside Kabul , Turkey did not agree to extend the mission area of the peace-keeping troops .
The United States has made it clear that it supports Turkey's position .
Karzai said on the 5th that Turkey's concern over its troops' potential involvement in renewed unrest in other areas of Afghanistan is redundant .
However , he also indicated that no matter what decision the peace-keeping nations make , the Afghan government will accept it .

A reporter asked : on April 11 , the plenary session of the European Parliament reviewed and adopted " European Parliament's Report on an EU Strategy towards China . "
How does China comment on this ?
Zhang Qiyue answered : China has noticed that the European Parliament has recently adopted this report .

It advocates development of the partnership between China and Europe , increase in bilateral contacts , exchanges and dialogs , and expansion of the cooperation between both sides in such fields as economics , trade , science and technology , education and culture .
We welcome all the above positive propositions .

But he disclosed that he will on this trip meet with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Economics and Trade and the relevant civil groups in mainland China in hopes that the Beijing authorities will agree to lift the ban on mainland fishermen working in Taiwan .
After mainland China banned its fishermen from going to work in Taiwan , there has been a serious shortage of fishermen in Ilan region . In order to help the shipowners in his constituency , Chen Chin-teh decided to go to Beijing and join the visiting delegation organized by the Fishing Association of Taiwan Province so as to help the owners of the fishing business , in the hope that mainland China can resume its labor-export of fishermen to Taiwan .
The visiting delegation made up of chairmen of the board of fishing associations from 13 districts of Taiwan is headed by Huang Yung-chu , secretary general of the Taiwan Provincial Fishery Association . It left for Beijing for a visit last Thursday under the name of " the Employees' Association of the Republic of China . "
Serious Sandstorm Hit Beijing Again
( Beijing , AFP ) The state media of China said that yesterday a serious sandstorm hit Beijing again .
Although the government has invested huge sums of money to improve the environment in Beijing and prevent the sandstorm from approaching Beijing , eliminating the sandstorms that occur frequently every year remains the major difficulty facing the City of Beijing where Olympics Games is to be held in 2008 .
China National Meteorological Bureau forecasts said that the first sandstorm of this year hit Beijing last Friday . The cold fronts from Mongolia are expected to envelop Beijing in a yellow dusty haze .
Yang Weixi ( transliterated ) , chief engineer of the Desertification Control Center of China's Ministry of Forestry told Beijing Review : " I can't say there will be no more sandstorms in 2008 .
What we can do is to control the human factors that cause sandstorms and prevent desertification of the environment . "
He said , however , natural factors beyond human control such as wind , drought , and vast deserts make it impossible for China to avoid sandstorms within a short period of time .
The Chinese government pledged to pour in 56.8 billion yuan ( 12.376 billion Singapore dollars ) from 2002 to 2008 to curb desertification and reduce the formation of sandstorms .
Beijing alone will spend about 1 billion yuan ( about 220 million Singapore dollars ) this year .
An expert from China Forestry Research Institute said : " Increased financial appropriations will greatly improve the situation , but . . . it may take decades to see the result of harnessing efforts . "
Chinese environmental experts warned after conducting a survey at the beginning of this year : About one third of the land in China is currently desert . It is mainly caused by human beings' economic activities such overgrazing .
The survey report said that in the first six months of last year , 18 sandstorms struck Beijing , and they all originated from Inner Mongolia where 60 % of the land is desert .
At the session of the National People's Congress ( NPC ) that just closed this month , deputies from Shanghai , Beijing and Inner Mongolia urged the government to " erect " a green great wall ( formed by trees ) " to block the assaults of sandstorms .
According to Shanghai Star , Xu Shiyuan , vice chairman of the Geographical Society of China , warned that if the government does not take emergency measures , sandstorms may even hit as far as Shanghai .
Fake Diplomas Run Rampant , Many Active Cadres Found to Hold Bogus Credentials
( Hong Kong , Syndicated news ) Fake diplomas are running rampant in mainland China . While verifying the degree certificates of 15 officials submitted by a city in Chaoshan District , College Graduates Placement Center of Guangdong Province confirmed seven of them as fake certificates just by the naked eye .
Hong Kong newspapers report that since the center started the verification service last May , it has so far verified more than 3,500 diplomas , of which over 800 are various types of fake credentials , accounting as much as 23 % of the total .
It is reported that certificates of adult education and self-study examinations make up the most of the fake credentials . Two-thirds are forged by the street solicitors , and the other one-third are issued by the regular education institutions in violation of regulations .
The chief official from the center also disclosed , their verification department was founded at a time when the organizational reform was underway . Therefore , their clients are mostly the government agencies , corporations and institutions . The ratio of the fake certificates among some of these clients is very high . Many fake certificate holders are all cadres in active duty .
Approved by the relevant agency of the Chinese Ministry of Education , the College Graduates Placement Center of Guangdong Province is currently the only authorized agency in China to verify diplomas and credentials of higher education in the country .
The chief official also disclosed that a state-owned municipal bank , in consideration of its employee promotion , sent the diplomas of 36 middle-level officials and key business personnel for verification . Only six of them were authentic .
It is reported that as the business of verification becomes popular , quite a few private enterprises also requested for the service . What they mainly wanted to verify were the job applicants and newly recruited college graduates .
The verification department found quite a few fake college diplomas .
Last year , a large corporation set up a branch in the Pearl River Delta and recruited a group of college students .
The boss sent over 30 diplomas and credentials of employees for verification and found ten of them were counterfeits .
In recent years , quite a few colleges and universities of other provinces have set up their branches in Guangdong Province . Actually , these schools are never qualified to issue any diplomas . Yet , in order to attract students , they resort to fraud at the time of recruitment , claiming they can issue state-accredited diplomas . When the students graduate , they simply forge these fake certificates and give them to the students .

The New Yorker Weekly : Iraqi Intelligence Agency in Close Contact with al Qaeda for Years
( Washington , Syndicated news ) The most recent issue of The New Yorker weekly reports that for years the Iraqi intelligence agency has been in close contact with al Qaeda network led by Osama who masterminded the September 11 attacks .
It is reported that these two organizations jointly command a terrorist organization in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq .
The CIA has always been skeptical about the claim that Iraqi President Hussein has been in touch with al Qaeda network .
The " Hawks " in the Bush Administration who support military actions against Iraq have been trying in the past to find evidence of Hussein's ties with al Qaeda network .
The day before yesterday , these officials praised highly the report by The New Yorker weekly , saying the report is the latest evidence that supports their argument .
The report said that there is an Ansar Muslim guerrilla made up of Kurds and Arabs in the Kurdish area of Iraq . The members of this guerrilla have all received training in Osama's camps .
The article's author Goldberg said that he interviewed several Ansar Muslim guerrilla's special agents captured by a pro-American Kurdish group , " the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan . " These special agents claimed that Ansar Muslim guerrilla is under the joint command of Hussein and al Qaeda network and that some al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan have already fled to the Kurdish area of Iraq controlled by Ansar Muslim guerrilla .
The special agents added that Iraq once hosted an al Qaeda leader of Egyptian origin in Baghdad in 1992 .
The US officials warned that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan may make full use of this report to prove that the US plan to overthrow Hussein regime is justifiable .
Newspapers in Gulf Countries Report : Cheney's Middle East Trip is a Failure
( Dubai , Syndicated news ) Newspapers in Gulf countries said on Monday that the US Vice President Cheney's trip to the Middle East is a failure .
Cheney's trip is to lobby the Middle East nations to support the United States in its attack against Iraq .
Cheney arrived in Kuwait on Monday after he visited all the Gulf nations , but even this most loyal ally of the US also objects to attacking Baghdad .
The Saudi Arabian newspaper " Motherland " said : " What this vice president has heard is : the United States must stop the Israeli terrorism and prevent Israel from possessing weapons of mass destruction . "
The newspaper also pointed out : " If the United States continues to ignore the interests of the Middle East nations , it will lose its interests in the Gulf region . "
The United Arab Emirates newspaper Gulf News also said : " This is a new failure of the United States in the Middle East after it ran into snags in Europe .
Most of the US allies in Europe publicly object to invading Iraq . "
Yesterday in Manama , the capital of Bahrain , Cheney denied the mission of his Middle East trip was to organize a military assault on Iraq .
He said at a joint press conference held with Crown Prince Salman that some people think his only interest during this trip is to organize a military assault on Iraq , but he denies that .
Cheney claimed that he and Crown Prince Salman mainly talked about the latest development in the war against terrorism , the situation in the Middle East and Afghanistan .
Cheney arrived in Israel on Monday evening for a visit . He is expected to meet with Prime Minister Sharon and discuss the latest development in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
On the other hand , the commanders-in-chief of Israel and Palestine in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip surprisingly held a talk yesterday aiming to end the violence in this region .
This talk may be the first step Israel has made in withdrawing its troops from the Palestinian controlled territories .
The Palestinian side said that if the Israeli troops do not withdraw from these areas , Palestine will not participate in any peace negotiations brokered by the United States .
Street Crimes Rose Sharply , Britain to Increase Police Patrol
( London , AP ) The British government will be committed to solving the ever-increasing street crimes and will increase police patrol .
Home Secretary Blunkett said that in order to curb the rising street muggings and violence , it is essential to increase police patrol .
He said , " We really should keep order in the street , because the law-abiding citizens hope to walk safely in the street , live a peaceful life and have no fear of being attacked . "
Although the overall crime rate in Britain has dropped , the street crimes increased 13 % from 2000 to 2001 .
The situation in London is even more alarming . From September to November of 2001 alone , the reported cases of robbery amounted to 19,248 , more than double the figure of 8,614 in the same period the year before .
The government also said the rise of crime cases was mainly due to the large increase of mobile phone robberies . Last year , there were more than 700,000 cases of mobile phone robbery in the country .
This is the first time that the British police have focused their forces on the street hooliganism and robbery , while the previous focus was mainly on cracking down on the illegal possession of firearms and drug dealing in the street .
This new plan will first be implemented in the ten neighborhoods where street crimes are more concentrated .
The police will increase patrols in these neighborhoods and provide more protection to the victims .
Workers in 10 State-owned Factories in Liaoning Staged Mass Demonstration
( Beijing , AFP ) Workers in 10 state-owned factories in Liaoyang , Liaoning Province in northeastern China staged a mass demonstration yesterday in protest of the overdue wages and pensions , low severance packages and embezzlement .
Meantime , the laid-off oil workers in Daqing , Heilongjiang Province have been continuously demonstrating for three weeks .

Some sources said that the workers in these two cities have established an independent labor union and decided to elect some representatives for negotiations .
Under the existing law , this action is not permitted .
Han Dongfang , executive of a Hong Kong-based organization of Chinese labor movement , said that although the two demonstrations started right after the National People's Congress ended its session , the problem has been there for quite a long time .
Han went on to say , a demonstration also took place in a textile factory on Monday in Guangyuan , Sichuan . It was triggered by the arrest of several labor leaders who organized weekend strikes . As a result , 1,000 workers staged a demonstration in protest .
Aviation Safety Council of Taiwan ( ASC ) Repeatedly Delayed Investigation Report on Singapore Airlines Crash , Causing Prosecutors to Smell a Rat
( Taipei ) A year and half have passed since the plane crash of the Singapore Airlines , yet Aviation Safety Council of Taiwan ( ASC ) has delayed the investigation report on the plane crash again and again , stalling the investigation by Taoyuan district prosecutor's office and causing the prosecutors to smell a rat . As for ASC , it has promised to deliver the investigation report in April .
At 11 : 18 p . m . on October 31 , 2000 , the Singapore Airlines Flight SQ-006 at Chiang Kai-shek Airport bound for Los Angeles entered by error the runway # 05 on the right side during take-off and crashed into the two digging machines and exploded , killing 83 passengers and injuring nearly a hundred passengers .
China Times reported yesterday that Taoyuan district prosecutor's office in charge of prosecuting for criminal liability after the plane crash has had several disputes over the right to investigate with ASC investigation unit .
Since the plane crash , Wang Tiensheng , former chief prosecutor of Taoyuan prosecutor's office , has been promoted to chief prosecutor of Taichong . Chen Shouhuang serves as his replacement . The case prosecutor Huang Moushin has also been transferred to Taipei prosecutor's office , handing over the case to Chiang Yuanchen .
Meanwhile , the original due date of the investigation report at the end of last year promised by ASC was postponed to the end of January . After the end of January , it was again changed to February . So far there has been no news . Urged by the prosecutors , ASC now promises to deliver the report in April .
As Los Angeles was the destination of Flight SQ-006 , some of the victims' families have already taken the case to the US court for huge sums of civil compensation , suing not only Singapore Airlines but also Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration .
The lawsuit by the victims' families for compensation is tantamount to accusing Taiwan Aviation Administration's Control Tower of negligence of duty . Therefore , the result of the investigation by Taoyuan prosecutor's office will draw all the more attention .

Another Warning for Global Warming , Antarctic Ice Shelf Collapsed
( Auckland , Syndicated news ) The experts at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center said yesterday that an Antarctic ice shelf has completely collapsed and broken up into thousands of icebergs . This is the largest single event of its kind over the last 30 years and therefore sends another warning about the global warming .
It is reported that the Larsen B Ice Shelf of 3,250 square kilometers on the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula has completely disintegrated in a 35 - day period .
The Center warned that with the advent of the hot summer season , the other ice shelves are also on the verge of disintegration .
This portends an increase in the rate of flow of glaciers in Antarctica , a rise in the global sea level and a threat to the lowland regions .
The Center at the University of Colorado says at its web site ( nsida . org ) that the Larsen B Ice Shelf that may have existed for 12,000 years and weighs 720 billion tons started to break up since January 31 of this year , and the ice fragments have formed thousands of drifting icebergs in the Weddell Sea .

More than Half of Britons Disapprove Government's Support of US Assault on Iraq
( London , Syndicated news ) A poll released yesterday shows that more than half of the British voters disapprove the government's support of the US assault on Iraq .
The polls by the Guardian and the polling firm ICM show that 51 % voters are opposed to British backing of the US assault on Iraq .

In Ottawa , the Canadian Prime Minister Chretien indicated the day before yesterday that if the United States leads the allied troops in attacking Iraq , Canada will consider joining .
Chretien and other Canadian ministers have been feeling uneasy about Bush's hardline position against the Iraqi regime of Hussein , and have been also insisting that no evidence has shown Hussein's ties to al Qaeda network .
But Chretien seems to have changed his original position after he went to hold talks with Bush in Washington D . C . last Thursday .
He told CBS that he will seriously consider any US request for military assistance in areas outside Afghanistan .
He said : " In terms of military involvement , if such a situation ( as in Afghanistan ) occurs in other areas , we will study the current situation just as we did when we participated in Afghan actions . "
US to Reduce Domestic Combat Air Patrol
( Washington , Reuters ) The US defense officials said on Monday that the Bush Administration has decided to reduce the alert level of combat air patrol that has been in effect since the Sept . 11 attacks , but will still maintain a small number of patrolling flights and keep the planes on strip alert .
The Pentagon said although the around-the-clock air patrol has cost the Air Force 500 million US dollars ( about 900 million Singapore dollars ) , the air patrol over Washington D . C . will continue . As for the New York area , the air patrol will discontinue unless there is an emergency .
As airports and airlines have heightened the security since the Sept . 11 attacks , the authorities have decided to reduce or cancel the air patrol .
The Pentagon spokeswoman Clark told the reporters : " We are studying a plan that will combine a mixture of various methods , including the combat air patrol over specified areas , intermittent combat air patrol on random orders and various levels of strip alerts . "
" Strip alert " means that planes are kept in readiness for emergent take-off at any time .
She also said that the alert will be adjusted at any time according to the level of threat .

US Senator : Smallpox-infected Terrorists Can Spread Disease at Airport
( Washington , AP ) The US senator Dr . Frist warned at a hearing on biochemical weapons the day before yesterday that smallpox-infected terrorists can spread the deadly virus or bacteria at airports and make the virus circulate in the entire country . This may cause thousands or even millions of deaths .
When a smallpox-infected terrorist enters into an airport , Frist said at the hearing , he can spread the virus to ten innocent passengers through coughing , sneezing or even merely breathing . These ten passengers can in turn spread the virus all over the nation , causing thousands or even millions of deaths through the disease .
He said this is one of the possible forms of weapons of mass destruction .
It does not have to be launched by a missile , nor will it attract the attention like anthrax .
Those infected victims and the defense personnel in charge of preventing this kind of weapon may never even know where these viruses ( bacteria ) come from .
Experts told Senate Foreign Relations Committee : That is the part of the reason why biochemical weapons are so dangerous .
Biden , chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said that preventing biochemical attacks is " an extremely urgent issue that must be taken care of . "
Senator Helms , the committee's most senior Republican , said that in order to prevent enemy missiles carrying any kind of warhead from attacking the United States , the United States still needs to build up its missile defense system .
Hundreds of Thousands of US and South Korean Soldiers to Launch Large-scale Military Exercise
( Seoul , AFP ) On Thursday , hundreds of thousands of US and South Korean soldiers will launch a largest military exercise in history which will simulate a conflict with North Korea . Pyongyang angrily labeled it as a provocation of war .
The US officers said on the eve of the week-long military exercise that the drill is purely defensive in nature , but it just takes place after South Korean authorities warned that the danger of North Korea is not to be ignored .
This is the largest-scale military exercise since the 1950 - 53 Korean War . As no formal agreement has been signed to end the conflict in the Korean Peninsular , the place has become the last front of the Cold War in the world . About 2 million soldiers are facing each other across the border .
The US-South Korean Combined Forces Command ( CFC ) in Seoul said that the military exercise from March 21 to March 27 will be testing for the first time the effectiveness of combining two different joint military exercises .
This means hundreds of thousands of soldiers will participate , but the military did not reveal any details .
The CFC spokesman said this exercise will mobilize almost every US and South Korean military unit in the Korean Peninsular and the US military from the outside .
37,000 American soldiers are permanently stationed in South Korea to prevent 1.1 million North Korean soldiers from attacking the South .
South Korea also has 650,000 soldiers .
The CFC named this exercise RS0I / FE02 , a combination of computerized military exercise with the annual " foal eagle " exercise .
In the past few years , 500,000 South Korean soldiers and 30,000 US soldiers were mobilized for RS0I exercise alone ( including 20,000 US soldiers from the outside ) .
North Korea accused the United States of launching the military exercise with an intention to provoke the war .
The official newspaper Rodong Sinmun even called the US-South Korean joint military exercise a " declaration of war . "
Chinese Media Praises Strategic Missile Corps
( Beijing , AFP ) Among the disputes over the US " Nuclear Posture Review " that lists China as a target for potential nuclear attacks , China's government media praised its own strategic missile corps yesterday .
" PLA Daily , " " People's Daily " and other government newspapers all carried at the front page " Forging a Shield of Peace for the Republic " in high praises of China's Second Artillery Corps that includes strategic missile and nuclear weapon units .
The article describes that this force uses " a strategic missile training simulation system " that simulates a nuclear attack from a hostile nation and the retaliation by the " Red Force " , or China .
The " Red Force " uses modern procedures to rapidly design a war plan and deploy new types of mobile missile launchers to remote mountains and forests .
The article filled with technical jargons describes how the Second Artillery Corps uses novel anti-jamming and anti-reconnaissance technologies to display their magic prowess .
The article goes on to say that one missile after another " rises into the sky from remote mountains and accurately hits its target , " making the counter-attack a success .
With an estimated strength of 100,000 troopers , the Second Artillery Corps is China's core unit in its effort to enhance the military capabilities and technologies .
This article that summarizes the growth of China's missile and nuclear weapon units from the late 1950s to the present is published at a time of renewed tensions between China and the United States .
China Steps up Security in Embassy District to Prevent North Koreans from " Storming Embassies " Again
( Hong Kong ) The Chinese police recently conducted an internal review over the incident that 25 North Koreans stormed the Spanish embassy last week .
It is estimated that in Beijing alone , more than 150 North Koreans are waiting for their chances to go to South Korea . The authorities have stepped up security on major embassies such as those of South Korea , Japan and Western nations in the embassy district so as to prevent " storming " incidents from happening again .
Singtao reported yesterday that public security sources indicated that since 25 North Koreans stormed the Spanish embassy by surprise on March 14 , Beijing police , in addition to the increased security it has provided to those embassies of sensitive nations , has further stepped up protection for the embassies of non-sensitive nations while maintaining a closer contact with the officials of North Korean and South Korean embassies in Beijing .
The sources pointed out , staff from the South Korean embassy indicated to the Chinese officials that South Korea does not encourage North Koreans to go to South Korea through this means and South Korea does not hope to see similar incidents again so that the relations between China and the Korean Peninsula are not affected . South Korea also promises China that it will assist China in managing the South Korean residents in Beijing .
It is disclosed that about 10,000 ethnic Koreans live in the eastern district of Beijing and Liangmahe in Chaoyang District . Among them are ethnic Koreans from Northeast China and those from North and South Koreas . They are mainly engaged in Korean style restaurant and bar businesses . Since they belong to the same Korean ethnic group , they get along quite well with each other no matter where they come from .
In the past , the authorities did not consider the ethnic Koreans as the focus of their supervision because they were not big in number in Beijing , nor did they get involved in so many criminal offenses like those people from Xinjiang and Henan .
It is reported that after the March 14 incident , the public security agency first " invited " the German doctor who assisted those 25 North Koreans for a " talk " at the public security agency and then escorted him to the airport for immediate departure from China .
Afterwards , the public security agency and the national security agency started an internal review .
The review mainly consists of two parts : the security protection of the embassy district and the management of the ethnic Koreans in Beijing .
In addition , the authorities also required the relevant agencies in regions such as Jilin to take effective measures to prevent North Koreans who have illegally crossed the border from entering Beijing .
Yellow Sanddust Eclipsing Sun over Korean Peninsula , Dust Covers Skies over Pyongyang and Seoul
( Syndicated news from Pyongyang and Seoul ) The sandstorm that just swept across Northern China hit the Korean Peninsula violently yesterday . Most of the regions , including Pyongyang , capital of North Korea and Seoul , capital of South Korea , were enveloped in a brownish dusty haze .
According to Xinhua News Agency , a strong sandstorm hit Pyongyang early yesterday morning .
From early in the morning , the entire city of Pyongyang was enveloped in a yellow dust .

Dusty weather has so far occurred three times in Seoul , South Korea this year .
The South Korea Meteorological Administration forecast yesterday : " Large quantities of dust lifted up by a strong uprising current of air occurring in the desert areas of China and Mongolia permeate the air over Northern China and will travel with the northwesterly wind to pass through South Korea .

Asteroid Powerful Enough to Destroy Mid-size City Brushed by Earth
( Florida , Melbourne , AP ) An asteroid large enough to destroy a mid-size city brushed the Earth within a short distance of 463,000 km without being detected in advance . Astronomers did not know the event until four days later .
About 50 meters in diameter , the asteroid came from the direction of the sun , making it very difficult for astronomers to discover it .
The asteroid brushed by the Earth on March 8 , but by the time it was discovered on March 12 , the asteroid had gone far away .
Williams from the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center located in Cambridge , Massachusetts had helped locate the position of the asteroid .
From the astronomical perspective , this asteroid is very close to the Earth , because the moon is 402,000 km away from the Earth .
Williams told " Florida Today " on Wednesday : " It is of critical importance the asteroid should have been detected before it came from the direction of the sun . "
In this way , astronomers will be able to verify the orbit of the asteroid as soon as possible and predict whether it will bump into the Earth .
In 1908 when an asteroid about the same size hit the Earth , it caused a pit as wide as 32 kilometers in the forests of Siberia .
Interior Minister Confirms Senior Italian Government Advisor Shot by " Red Brigade "
( Rome , AFP ) Italian Interior Minister Scajola confirmed the day before yesterday that the senior Italian government advisor Biagi was shot to death by a branch unit of the extremist left-wing guerrilla " Red Brigade . "
Scajola said , the two men who killed Biagi even used the same pistol that was used to carry out a similar political assassination three years ago .
On the other hand , after Biagi's assassination , the Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi offered to invite the Labor Union leaders back to the negotiation table and to discuss the employment reform plan he proposed .
Biagi , the 52 - year-old advisor for the Ministry of Labor , was also an economist and law professor .
He was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle when he was riding his bike back to his home in the northern city of Bologna . The shooting shocked the Italian political circle .
Biagi had assisted in drafting an employment reform plan that was strongly opposed by the Labor Union and the leftists .
They believed the plan would make it easier for employers to fire workers .
Eyewitnesses said that Biagi was lying in a pool of blood alongside his briefcase .
The door of Biagi's home was also found to be carved with a Red Brigade symbol of five stars , but at this time it is not clear when the symbol was carved .
Established in 1973 , Red Brigade was suspected in many bombings and assassinations in Italy during the 70s and 80s , including the abduction and murder of the former Prime Minister Moro in 1978 .

The attorney representing Fang Fuming said that his client has already been imprisoned for two years , but China said it was not that long .
Xinhua News Agency confirmed the ruling .
It said , from 1995 to 1999 , Fang Fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets and gave 245,000 US dollars ( about 450,000 Singapore dollars in current value ) in bribes to state workers to assist foreign investors bidding for China's power construction projects .
Fang Fuming was an electrical engineering consultant for a foreign company in its China and other Asian offices .
Cohen , the attorney representing Fang Fuming , said that Fang Fuming denied giving bribes and said he was a victim to the embezzling Chinese officials in the power industry .
Once a Chinese official in the power industry , Fang Fuming became a US citizen in 1994 .
In the past two years , a number of US citizens and residents were accused of violating the Chinese national security laws . Fang Fuming was one of them .
The arrest of Fang Fuming had temporarily caused tensions between China and the United States .
The US government repeatedly protested against the way China handled the case of Fang Fuming , accusing the Chinese authorities of violating the international norms by detaining Fang Fuming for several months without any trial .
The family members of Fang Fuming said he was badly treated .
His wife and two children are all US citizens .
Cohen said , Fang Fuming was detained on February 28 , 2000 , but the date of custody set by the Chinese Foreign Ministry is August 28 , 2000 .
China Called off Naval Fleet's Visit to the US , Declined to Confirm Whether Hu Jintao Will Visit US as Planned
( Beijing , Syndicated news ) The Sino-US relation that was heated momentarily by the US President Bush's visit to China is cooling down rapidly . China confirmed yesterday that it has called off its naval fleet visit to the US ports this year and refused to confirm whether the country's Vice President Hu Jintao will visit the United States as planned .
The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said while answering reporters' questions at a routine press conference : " As far as I know , China's naval fleet is preparing for a visit as planned ; its itinerary does not include the US ports . "
When a reporter asked her twice whether Hu Jintao's plan to visit the United States is affected and whether she can clarify that an earlier answer can be interpreted as an indication that Hu Jintao will visit the US in April as scheduled , Zhang Qiyue would not make any further comments nor would she confirm anything .
Zhang Qiyue only repeatedly accused the US of " doing a series of things that violate the three joint communiques between China and the US " within a short period of one month after President Bush's visit to China and demanded that the US " stop using the issue of Taiwan to interfere in China's internal affairs . "
On the other hand , in Washington D . C . , the US ignored on Wednesday China's warning that a " chilly wind " is blowing over the Sino-US relations and insisted that there is nothing wrong with the US permission of Taiwan's defense minister to attend " US-Taiwan Defense Summit " held in Florida .
Beijing repeatedly attacked the US for issuing a visa to Taiwan's Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming earlier this month and allowing him to attend a conference sponsored by the US arms manufacturers .
Tang Yiau-ming also met with two senior US officials at the time .
At a routine press conference , State Department spokesman Boucher was hounded by reporters asking about China's complaints over this issue , but obviously he was trying his best to avoid a battle of words with China .
He said : " After this meeting , our position is well-known to all .
If you want to ask me about this every day , I am willing to explain it every day . If China wants to ask about this every day , we are willing to explain it every day . "
He said : " The position hasn't changed . These are our normal contacts with the Taiwanese . We will continue to do so . "
Zhang Qiyue also confirmed yesterday the Russian media's report , saying that the Chinese President Jiang Zemin called the Russian President Putin by phone at his request the night before , and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between China and Russia based on mutual benefits .
Both sides believe it is in the interest of both nations and peoples to develop mutually beneficial cooperations between China and Russia .
