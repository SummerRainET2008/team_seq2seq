Bahraini Princess Married US Soldier , Sensational Marriage Breaks up in Five Years
Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa's marriage with the humble US marine Johnson was once a widely hailed story by US television channels . However , their thorny marriage has now ended in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after lasting for just five years .
The fairy-tale marriage between Meriam , a member of the Gulf state of Bahrain's royal family , and US marine Johnson , who devoted himself to this banned love affair , risking his military career , became the subject of a television movie .
But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that merely five years had passed before the couple confronted each other in court when Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town where procedures for marriages are quick and for dissolutions are quicker .
The two met in 1999 when Johnson was a career army man stationed in Bahrain .
But his life changed dramatically when he met the young teenage princess and the pair fell in love .
The young couple's union was forbidden by the royal family , so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , taking her out of her home country to the US .
After a bitter immigration lawsuit against US authorities , the couple married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip famed for its magnificence when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19 .
But Johnson said the wealth of temptations in the " sin city " of Las Vegas , ongoing tensions with Meriam's wealthy and powerful family , and rumors of a plot to assassinate him had finally contributed to the breakup of the thorny marriage .
Johnson said he made a living parking cars for hotel and casino guests , while Meriam increasingly indulged in the nightlife of the gambling town , frequenting night clubs late at night and ignoring him as her husband .
