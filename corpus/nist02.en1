Taufik , now ranked 33rd , might play in the second or third singles and his physiological burden will be lighter than playing in the first singles .
In the group competition , a win in the first singles can affect later competitions or at least affect fellow teammates' feeling and encourage them to win .

Indonesia's chance of defending the Thomas Cup title has been increased after the return of Taufik since the young player is a very strong player in the world , the club chairman said .
Alisanto believes the return of Taufik to the Indonesian national team gives Indonesia hopes to defeat opponents including host China .
A badminton web site survey have found that 45 % of the respondents said Indonesia might be able to defend their Thomas Cup title , 21 % believed China could be the champion while 17 % considered Malaysia to have the best chance , according to a press report .

Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chen Chin-teh to visit Beijing together with fishing associations
Comprehensive report , Beijing -- A delegation comprising of Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) legislator Chen Chin-teh and several associations in fishery have arrived Beijing yesterday .
Chen will be the first DPP member to travel to the mainland since China's Vice Premier Qian Qichen said earlier this year that DPP members are welcome to visit the mainland in an appropriate capacity during a ceremony in commemoration of the seventh anniversary of " Jiang eight-points " .
Chen left for Hong Kong to obtain the necessary visa on Saturday . He arrived Beijing yesterday for a 10 - day visit .

Beijing attacked by another serious sandstorm
Agence France Presse , Beijing -- According to Chinese State Media , Beijing had another serious sandstorm yesterday .
Despite costly environmental efforts to halt the advance of the desert to Beijing , sandstorms continue their frequent annual assault on the capital city . Sandstorms look like to remain a serious challenge to Beijing , which is going to host the 2008 Olympics .
According to China Meteorological Administration's forecasts , the year's first sandstorm struck Beijing last Friday with further windy cold fronts from the Mongolian steppe expected to shroud Beijing in a yellow , dusty haze .
" I cannot say sandstorms won't occur in 2008 , " Yang Weixi ( transliteration ) , chief engineer of the Desertification Control Center of China's Ministry of Forestry told the Beijing Weekend publication .
" What we can do is to manage the man-made factors which cause sandstorms and the expansion of desertification , " he said .
However , conditions beyond human control , like wind , drought and huge existing deserts , would make it impossible to get rid of the storms in a short time frame , Yang said .
The Chinese government has committed to spend Renminbi 56.8 billion ( about Singapore Dollars 12.376 billion ) to curb desertification and lessen sandstorms between 2002 and 2008 .
Beijing alone will spend approximately Renminbi 1 billion ( about Singapore Dollars 220 million ) this year .
" The increase in funding will greatly improve the situation , but . . . it may take decades to see a gradual improvement , " an expert of the China Forestry Research Institute said .
Chinese environmentalists raised alarm bells after a survey earlier this year , which found almost a third of the country's land mass is now desert largely due to human economic activity , such as livestock overgrazing .
In the first six months of 2001 , Beijing was hit by 18 sandstorms originating from Inner Mongolia , where 60 percent of the land is desert , the survey said .
National People's Congress lawmakers from Shanghai , Beijing and Inner Mongolia , who met in Beijing this month , have urged the government to set up a " green wall " of trees to block the dust storms .
The vice president of the Geographical Society of China , Xu Shiyuan , warned that if the government failed to take action , sandstorms could blow as far as Shanghai , the Shanghai Star newspaper said .
Forged diplomas are flooding China ; some cadres on the job are also holding forged diploma
Comprehensive report , Hong Kong -- False diplomas are flooding Mainland China . Guangdong College Graduate Career Center has completed the verification of academic certificates held by fifteen government officials submitted to the center by a city in Chao-Shan regions . Seven of them can be confirmed to be a forgery simply through visual examination .
According to reports in Hong Kong newspapers , the Center commenced verification services since May this year . It has so far examined more than 3,500 certificates and more than 800 certificates are found to be forgeries of one kind or the other . That is a forging rate of 23 % .
According to the reports , most of the forged certificates relate to Adult Education and self-study examination certificates . Approximately two-third are forged in the street and the other one-third are forged by formal educational institutions .
At the time the center was first established , many institutions are in the process of reform . Hence , units of organizations or enterprises have submitted the bulk of the certificates for verification . In many cases , the owners of the forged certificates are actually cadres currently on the job , the officer-in-charge of the Center said .
At present , Guangdong College Graduate Career Center is the only institution authorized by the related department of China's Ministry of Education to provide higher education qualification verification services in China
In one occasion , to facilitate decision on selecting officer , a municipal level State-owned bank has sent in 36 diplomas of middle-level officers and some key cadres for verification . The result is that only 6 diplomas are genuine , the officer-in-charge said .
It is understood that many private enterprises have also employed the verification services and their main interests are diplomas of job applicants and newly recruited university students .
The verification department has also found many forged university credentials
Last year , a large enterprise has recruited a large batch of university students for its branch office in Zhu Jiang delta area .
The boss has sent in the credentials of more than 30 employees for verification and it was found that ten of them were forgeries .
In recent years , many educational institutions from rest of China have established a branch office in Guangdong . These institutions have no rights to confer educational qualification . However , these institutions frequently play tricks to attract more students and claim that they can confer certificates recognized by the State . When students graduate , these institutions have to make a batch of forged certificates for the students .

New Yorker magazine : Iraqi intelligence has been in close touch with al-Qaida group for years
Comprehensive report , Washington -- The latest issue of New Yorker magazine suggests that Iraqi intelligence has been in close touch with top officials in al-Qaida group for years . The al-Qaida group is believed to have masterminded the 911 incident .
It is believed that the two organizations jointly run a terrorist group that operates in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq .
U . S . Central Intelligence Agency has expressed doubts on the proposition that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has maintained links with al-Qaida .
A " hawkish " faction within the Bush administration that favors military action against Iraq has scoured the world for such Saddam-al-Qaida connections .
Yesterday some people in this camp hailed the " New Yorker " article as significant new evidence supporting their viewpoint .
The article said there is a Muslim guerrilla group in the Kurdish zone of Iraq called Ansar al-Islam , which is made up of Iraqi Kurds and Arabs trained in bin Laden's camps .
The article's author , Jeffrey Goldberg , wrote that he interviewed several operatives of the group who had been captured by the " Patriotic Union of Kurdistan " ( PUK ) , a pro-American Kurdish group . The captives said that Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida are running Ansar . A number of al-Qaida fighters fleeing Afghanistan have already escaped to Iraqi Kurdish territory controlled by Ansar .
These captives also said that Iraq hosted a top Egyptian leader of al-Qaida in Baghdad in 1992
U . S . officials warned that the PUK has an interest in making this case because it could help justify an American incursion to topple Saddam .
Gulf States newspaper : Cheney's tour of the Middle East a failure
Comprehensive report , Dubai -- The newspapers in Gulf States called U . S . Vice President Cheney's tour of the Middle East a failure on Monday .
The purpose of Cheney's trip is to win supports of Middle East countries in case of a U . S . attack on Iraq .
Cheney arrived Kuwait on Monday after visiting all other Gulf States . However , even this most loyal ally to U . S . opposes an attack on Baghdad .
Saudi Arabian newspaper said , " What this vice president heard was : U . S . must stop Israeli's terrorist actions and prevent Israel from owning weapons of mass destruction . "
The news article also said , " If U . S . continues to ignore the interests of the Gulf States , it will lose its interests in the Gulf areas . "
United Arab Emirates " Gulf Daily " said , " The Middle East is a new failure to U . S . after its setbacks in Europe .
Most U . S . allies have openly opposed any attack on Iraq . "
Cheney has denied yesterday that the purpose of his tour is to organize a military attack against Iraq when he was in Manama , the capital of Bahrain .
" Some people think I am only interested in organizing a military attack against Iraq but that is not the case , " Cheney said in a joint press conference with Bahrain's Prince Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa .
Cheney said that he has mainly discussed with Prince Salman the war on terrorism and the latest developments in Middle East and Afghanistan .

In England , soaring levels of street-crime : more officers on the beat
Associated Press , London -- The British government steps up the efforts to fight soaring levels of street-crime and intends to deploy more policemen to patrol the streets .
Home Secretary David Blunkett said it is important to have more patrol officers if the government is to control the soaring levels of robbery and violence on the streets .
" We really have to tackle the problem of street-crime . Law-abiding citizens want to feel safe when they walk on the street . They want a peaceful life and untroubled by attack , " he said .
Notwithstanding the overall crime rate in England is declining , the number of street-crime has increased by 13 % from 2000 to 2001 .
The situation in London is even more astonishing , the number of reported robbery during September 2001 to November 2001 is 19,248 , which is more than double of the 8,614 cases in same period last year .
According to the British government , the massive increase in robbery is mainly due to soaring mobile phone snatchings . About 700,000 mobile phones were snatched last year .
This is the first time that British police will target street rogues and street robbery . In the past , actions are usually directed at illegal possession of firearms and drug trafficking on the streets .
The new program will first be carried out in 10 areas , which suffer most from soaring street-crimes .
The police will step up patrols in these areas in order to increase the protection to victims .

According to Han , there was a similar protest at a textile factory in Guangyuan Shi , Sichuan on Monday . More than 1000 workers participated in a protest against arrests of a few of their leaders who tried to organize a protest on the coming weekend .
Singapore Airlines' crash in Taiwan : Aviation Safety Council has delayed its report ; prosecutor's office is asking why
Taipei news -- The Singapore Airlines crash had happened for more than one and half years . However , Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council ( SAC ) has delayed the release of its final report several times , which has effectively made the investigation by Taoyuan prosecutor's office to a standstill . The prosecutor's office is challenging the rationale and SAC has now undertaken to release a report before end of April .
On October 31 , 2000 at 11 : 18 PM , Singapore Airlines' SQ-006 attempted to take off from Chiang Kai Shek International Airport for Los Angeles . In the course of the take off , the plane entered 05 - right runway . The plane then hit two dredgers that were on the runway . The impact caused an explosion and the death of 83 passengers . More than 100 passengers were injured in the accident .
" China Times " reported yesterday : The Taoyuan prosecutor's office has been investigating for possible criminal liabilities in parallel to a probe into the cause of the crash by SAC . Unfortunately , the two have several disputes over investigation rights .
From the date of the crash till now , Taoyuan district court chief prosecutor Wang Teng-sheng in charge of the case was promoted chief prosecutor for Taichung . Chen Sou-huang filled his position . The case was then taken over by prosecutor Huang Mo-hsin but he was also transferred to Taipei later . The case is currently the responsibility of Chiang Yuan-chen .
SAC originally says that they can complete the investigation by the end of last year . SAC subsequently delayed the report to end of January . By January , SAC changed the report date to end of February and there is no further news since then . After pressed by the prosecutor's office , SAC has now undertaken to delver a report by the end of April .
The destination of SQ-006 was Los Angeles and some passengers are Americans . Hence , some family members of passengers who died in the crash have already commenced legal actions in U . S . courts for damages against Singapore Airlines and also in some cases , against Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration .
The claims by family members are equivalent to an accusation of negligence on the part of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration . Hence , the conclusion of the investigation by Taoyuan prosecutor's office becomes important .

A new alarm over global warming : An Antarctic ice shelf has collapsed
Comprehensive report , Auckland -- Experts of the US National Snow & Ice Data Center said yesterday that an ice shelf in Antarctica has collapsed and broken into thousands of icebergs . This is the largest ice shelf collapse in 30 years and clearly a new alarm over global warming .
According to reports , an area of 3,250 square kilometers of the Larsen B Ice Shelf has shattered and disintegrated over a 35 - day period .
The center warned that other ice shelves are also on the verge of collapse with the arrival of hot summer .
That would portend increased flows of glacial ice from Antarctica and a rise in global sea levels , endangering low-lying land areas .
The center , based at University of Colorado , said on its website ( nsidc . org ) that the Larsen B Ice Shelf , a 720 - billion-ton block of ice which could be as old as 12,000 years , began to disintegrate on January 31 . The shattered ice formed thousands of icebergs adrift in the Weddell Sea .
According to the center , the disintegration of the ice shelf is due to a warmer climate in that region .
Over half of all British voters disapprove British support for an American attack on Iraq
Comprehensive report , London -- According to an opinion poll released yesterday , more than half of all British voters do not support British government's backing of a U . S . attack on Iraq .
" Guardian " and ICM , an opinion survey agency , conducted the opinion poll jointly . The result shows that 51 % of the voters do not support British government's stance of backing a U . S . attack on Iraq .

However , Jean Chretien seems to have changed his original stance after a meeting with Bush last Thursday in Washington .
He said in a CBC interview that he would seriously consider any U . S . requests for providing military assistance in areas outside Afghanistan .
He said , " So far as troop involvement is concerned , if there were to be a situation like that ( Afghanistan ) developing elsewhere , we will look at that situation at that time . Just like what we have done when participating in the actions in Afghanistan . "

'Strip alerts' refer to warplanes at ready-to-go condition that can take off at short notices .
She also said the alertness will change according to the level of potential threat .

US senator said : Terrorist infected with smallpox can spread virus in airport
Associated Press , Washington -- At a biological and chemical weapons hearing on the day before yesterday , US Senator Dr Frist warned that terrorists infected by smallpox can spread the lethal virus or microbe while passing through airports . That is already sufficient to spread the virus across America and may lead to deaths of tens of thousands or even millions .
At the hearing , Frist said that a smallpox-infected terrorist would walk into an airport and he can spread the virus to 10 innocent travelers through coughing , sneezing or even breathing alone . The infected travelers can , in turn , spread the virus across the nation and tens of thousands or even millions may contact the disease and die .
He said that this could be the form of a massive lethal weapon .
It does not need to be launched as in the case of a missile . It is also not as noticeable as anthrax spores .
Infected victims as well as defense personnel responsible for stopping such attacks may never know where the virus or microbes come from .
Experts told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that this is part of the reason why biological weaponry is so dangerous .
United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman Biden said that biological weapon attacks is 'the most pressing problem that we must be paid attention to' .
The most senior Republican Senator on the Committee , Jesse Helms said that US still needs to establish antimissile system for the sake of protecting U . S . from enemy warheads , no matter which type it happens to be .
Hundreds of thousands of U . S . and South Korean troops to stage large scale exercises
Agence France Presse , Seoul -- Hundreds of thousands of U . S . and South Korean soldiers will launch the biggest ever military exercises on Thursday to stimulate a conflict with North Korea . Pyongyang has condemned the exercise as an act to provoke war .
U . S . military official said on Monday , the eve before the weeklong maneuvers , that the drills would be purely defensive . However , the drills are taking place at a time after Seoul issued a warning about the danger of ignoring the North Korea threat .
This is the biggest military exercise since the 1950 - 53 Korean War . As there has never been any official treaty to end that conflict , the Korean peninsula has become the world's last cold war battlefront , with almost 2 million troops counterworking at the frontier .
The joint U . S . -South Korean Combined Forces Command in Seoul said that the exercise to be held from March 21 to 27 will combine two separate joint military exercises for the first time to test for the overall effectiveness .

The Combined Forces Command spokesman said that this exercise would mobilize nearly every U . S . and South Korean military unit on the Korean peninsula . In addition , some US troops from abroad will also take part in it .
There are 37,000 U . S . troops stationed in South Korea to guard against possible attacks from North Korea . The North has a large army with 1.1 million men .
South Korea also has 650,000 armed forces .
The Combined Forces Command calls this exercise RSOI / FE02 because it merges a computerized war game with the annual 'Foal Eagle' exercises .
In the past few years , 500,000 South Korean army and 30,000 US troops ( including 20,000 U . S . troops from abroad ) were mobilized in the RSOI alone .
Pyongyang has accused U . S . of using the joint military exercise to provoke war .

China has tightened security in embassy areas to prevent North Koreans from 'storming embassy' again

Some of them are ethnic North Koreans coming from northeast China . Others have come from either North Korea or South Korea . They are mainly engaged in running North Korean restaurants and bars . Thus , they can get along with one another irrespective of where they have come from .
There were not so many North Koreans in Beijing in the past . Also , unlike those from Xinjiang and Henan , who often involve in criminal acts , North Koreans were not key monitoring targets of the authorities .
Reportedly , Public Security has 'invited' the German doctor , who has assisted the 25 North Koreans , to their office for a 'talk' right after the incident on March 14 . Soon afterwards , Public Security has sent him to the airport and the doctor has to leave immediately .
After the doctor is gone , Public Security and the State Security Department have conducted an internal review .
The review involved two main areas : First , security in the embassy areas , and second , the management of North Koreans in Beijing .
Meanwhile , the authorities have also requested relevant departments in Jilin areas to take more effective measures to stop illegal North Korea immigrants from getting to Beijing .

Large enough to flatten an average city , asteroid brushed past the Earth at close shave
Associated Press , Melbourne and Florida -- An asteroid , large enough to flatten an average city , brushed past the Earth within a short range of 463,000 kilometers , but was not discovered in time . It was four days after the close shave could astronomers tell about it .
This asteroid , about 50 meters in diameter , was flying from the direction of the sun , thus astronomers could hardly detect it .
The asteroid brushed past the Earth on March 8 , but was not detected until March 12 when the asteroid was gone .
Williams of the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center in Cambridge , Massachusetts , has helped in determining the astronomical position of this asteroid .
From the astronomical point of view , this asteroid was very close to the Earth because the moon is only 402,000 kilometers away from the Earth .
Williams on Wednesday spoke to 'Florida Today' , " The key is to detect asteroids before they are flying from the direction of the sun . "
Thus , astronomers can determine an asteroid's orbit sooner , predicting whether it will hit the Earth or not .
When an asteroid of similar size hit the Earth in 1908 , it blasted out a crater of 32 kilometers wide in the forest of Siberia .
Interior minister confirmed Italian government senior advisor shot dead by 'Red Brigades'
Agence France Presse , Rome-Italian Interior Minister Scajola confirmed the day before yesterday that Italian government senior advisor Biagi was shot dead by a sect of the leftist guerrilla group 'Red Brigades' .
Scajola said that the two gunmen even used a similar pistol that was used in another political assassination 3 years ago to gun down Biagi .
On the other side , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , after Biagi's assassination , has voluntarily invited union leaders to return to the negotiating table for discussions on Biagi's proposed labor reform plan .
The 52 - year-old labor ministry advisor was an economist and a professor in the science of law .
He was on Tuesday night shot to death by two motorcyclists outside his home in the northern city of Bologna right after he biked home . The news shocked the Italian political circles .
Biagi had helped in drafting a labor reform proposal that provoked strong protests from labor unions and the leftists .
They thought that the proposal would make it easier for employers to layoff workers .
A witness said that Biagi was lying in a pool of blood , with his briefcase on the side .
Red Brigades' five-star symbol has been engraved on the door of Biagi's home . However , it is not known at this moment when that was done .
Formed in 1973 , Red Brigades were suspected of carrying out a series of bombings and assassinations in the 70s and 80s , including the kidnapping and killing of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978 .

When questioned by a reporter twice if Hu Jintao's scheduled trip to the US would be affected , Zhang Qiyue did not comment or confirm . She also made no further comments on requests to clarify whether her answer earlier to a question can be interpreted as saying Hu Jintao's April visit to the US would take place as planned .
Zhang Qiyue merely accused the US side for repeatedly 'violating the promises laid out in the three Sino-US joint communiques in a series of moves' just within a month after Bush's China visit . She also requested the US side 'to stop using the Taiwan issue in meddling China's internal affairs . '
On the other side , in Washington on Wednesday , the US paid no attention to China's warning about the'icy breeze' being blown over Sino-US relations . US insisted that there is nothing wrong to allow Taiwan's defense minister to attend the'US-Taiwan defense summit' in Florida .
Beijing has criticized US repeatedly in granting visa to Taiwan's Defense Minister Tang Yiauming for attending a conference organized by the US weapons industry earlier this month .
Tang Yiauming also met two US senior officials during his time in US .
In a news briefing , the State Department spokesman Boucher was questioned by reporters about China's protests against this matter . However , he apparently tried to avoid opening up a verbal battle with China .
He said , " After this conference , our position is clear to all .
If you want to ask me about this matter every day , I am willing to explain it every day . If China wants to ask this matter every day , we are willing to explain it every day . "
He said , " The position has never changed . This is our normal contact with the people of Taiwan and we will keep on doing it . "
Zhang Qiyue also confirmed yesterday a report by the Russian media that President Jiang Zemin was requested by Russian President Putin to hold a telephone conversation with him the night before . The two sides exchanged opinions on the issue of Sino-Russian mutual cooperation .
Both sides do believe that carrying out Sino-Russian mutual cooperation is in the interest of both countries and their people .
