Bahraini Princess Married US Soldier , Astonishing 5 - Year Marriage Comes to End
The marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and Johnson , a US marine , was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by US television stations . The star-crossed marriage , however , lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas .
Meriam is a member of the Gulf State of Bahrain's royal family . Johnson risked his military career for this forbidden love . Their marriage , resembling a fairy tale , was once the theme of a TV drama .
However , as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal , five years have scarcely passed when the two confronted each other in court as Meriam filed with the court for divorce in Las Vegas , where quick marriages but even quicker divorces are granted .
The pair met in 1999 when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain .
After he met this little princess who is still in her teens , both fell in love with each other , which changed his life tremendously .
Since their union was forbidden by the royal family , Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , then sneaked her out of her motherland and brought her to the United States .
After a bitter immigration lawsuit with US authorities , the young couple finally got married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip known for its dazzling grandeur when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19 .
However , Johnson said that due to temptations in Las Vegas , otherwise known as a " Sin City , " his constant tensions with Meriam's rich and powerful family , and rumors of an assassination plot at his life , this star-crossed marriage eventually failed to survive .
Johnson said he made a living by valet parking for guests of hotels and casinos , while Meriam gradually indulged herself to the nightlife in the gambling city , frequenting nightclubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband .
